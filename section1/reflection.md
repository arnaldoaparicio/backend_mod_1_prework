## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  It lists steps that allow you to learn and challenge yourself while
  also putting emphasis on taking a break and not burning yourself out.
  Something that I already do is viewing learning as a process, having a growth mindset and teaching others what I already know. Something I want to do more of is read more, taking breaks, and take care of my brain.
  Something I would add to this list is not giving up at the first sign of hardship. Something many people do is give up as soon as a task becomes difficult. Instead of giving up, they should see it through and try it out some more and ask for help before completely giving up.

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation is another form of sticking strings together, similar to concatenation with the + operator.

animal = "silverback gorilla"
puts "The #{animal} is considered the most endangered species of gorilla."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

The method used to get input from a user is called "gets".

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
One common string method is the length method. It tells you how many characters are in a string, which also includes spaces.

Example
   food = "Cheesecake"
   food.length
   => 10 #returns 10 since it is the number of characters in the string.

Another common string method is the split method. It breaks a string into parts in the form of an array.

Example
sentence = "This is it!"
sentence.split
=> ["This", "is", "it!"]
