## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- One thing that resonated with me is in the video Carmen describes how professors in college were not really encouraging to the students who were trying hard to understand the material. I have experienced something similar with one of my CS professors.

- Something else that resonated with me was seeking out challenges. I have not really sought out challenges pertaining to code before but rather focus on what was given to me by an instructor.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- I understand that mistakes are essential to learning. Typing out the code exercises, I have made many mistakes and tried over and over again to fix it and run it until it is solved. I also practice my coding to improve my skills. I take part of the exercises and try to edit it and see what would happen if I changed anything.

- One way I do not is seeking help. I am sometimes hesistant to seek out help out of fear of looking dumb or not understanding it compared to my peers. I also do not actively seek out challenges. It often feels intimidating seeking out other practice challenges out of fear or how overwhelming they can become.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

- A hash is a way to store data. It is different from an array in which an array uses numbers to retrieve data but with a hash, you can use anything to retrieve data.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```ruby
pet_store = {"bags_of_dog_food" => 10,
             "bottles_of_flea_spray" => 3,
             "cans_of_wet_cat_food" => 9,
             "bags_of_bird_feed" => 20,
             "boxes_of_cat_toys => 2"
}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

- You would access the value "Iowa" by typing "states["IA"]".


1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
- To access all keys, type "states.keys". To access all the values, type "states.values".

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

- We may use a hash to store a person's information such as name, age, and height. Hash is better than an array because with a hash, you can type in the key you need, such as "name" if it were in a hash, and easily retrive the information you need. Using an aray, you may not always remember where in the array certain information is stored.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
- Can we store a hash within a hash within another hash?
